# Code Refactoring Prompt

Please analyze the codebase and perform the following refactoring tasks:

## Tasks

1. **Improve Code Readability**
   - Add meaningful variable and function names
   - Break down complex functions into smaller, focused ones
   - Remove code duplication

2. **Add Type Safety**
   - Ensure all functions have proper TypeScript types
   - Add interface definitions where appropriate
   - Fix any `any` types

3. **Error Handling**
   - Add try-catch blocks for error-prone operations
   - Implement proper error messages
   - Handle edge cases

4. **Documentation**
   - Add JSDoc comments to public functions
   - Update README if needed
   - Add inline comments for complex logic

## Guidelines

- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep changes focused and incremental
- Ensure all tests still pass after changes
- Follow existing code style and conventions

Please implement these improvements systematically.
